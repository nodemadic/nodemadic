I'm a software engineering student currently grounding myself in my fundamentals to look for my next opportunity in early summer 2022. 

I've been recently obsessed with digging into the [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) ecosystem and the potential that [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/) brings to the crypto community, but I am not a maximalist. Feel free to reach out to me for any type of project or if you have any suggestions for things that I should be learning. 

Some topics that I love to research and discuss:
- Habits
- Free will
- Morality
- Incentive allignment
- Role of governance
- Health
- Media consumption

Here are all the ways you can reach me:

- Add me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/925582738466172969)
- Check out my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nodemadic)
- Message me on [Telegram](https://t.me/nodemadic)
- Email me at nodemadic@gmail.com

Let's build something :)
